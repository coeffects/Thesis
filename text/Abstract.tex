\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

Static type systems are the most common form of program verification. In their most basic form, type
systems guarantee that a computation always returns a value of some type. The work on monads
and effect systems extends type systems to guarantee properties about \emph{effectful 
computations} that perform side-effects like non-termination, I/O operations or exceptions.

In this thesis we extend type systems to guarantee properties about \emph{context-dependent
computations}. Such computations are increasingly common in modern software. For example, applications
accessing data need to guarantee that the right data is available and distributed systems need to 
guarantee that resources are available on specific nodes.

We develop three \emph{coeffect} type systems that are capable of capturing different context-dependent
properties. All three systems are based on the unifying semantic structure called \emph{indexed
comonads}, but they use it differently. 

Our \emph{flat coeffect calculus} tracks one annotation about the entire context. It can be used to
keep a set of required resources or a set of supported platforms. Our \emph{structural coeffect 
calculus} tracks one annotation for each variable. It can be used to track liveness of variables
or number of past values needed in data-flow computations. Finally, our \emph{coeffect meta-language}
embeds contextual values directly into a language. It can be used to capture context-dependent 
properties of meta-programming languages and mobile values in distributed computation.
